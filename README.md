### Selectors in css3
```
p [name^="my"] {font-size: 20px; }
^= will be assigned to any <p> element with a name attribute value begining with "my" (e.g. "mytext","mycar")

p [name$="my"] {font-size: 20px; }
$= will be assigned to any <p> element with a name attribute value ending with "my" (e.g. "textmy","carmy")

p [name*="my"] {font-size: 20px; }
*= will match any <p> element with a name attribute value containing the substring "my" (the substring could also be in the middle -- for e.g. in "textmycar"
```

### hsla

The syntax is: color: hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, opacity);  
hue - from 0 to 360 degrees. Around 0 and 360 - red colors, around 120 - green, around 240 - blue
saturation - from 0% (grey scale) to 100% (full color ot fully saturated)
lightness - from 0% (completely dark to 100% (completely light) 
```
